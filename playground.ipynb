One of the first acts of William I the Conqueror was to accord a charter promising the citizens of London that they should enjoy the same laws as under Edward the Confessor and that he would suffer no one to do them wrong. Just outside the city walls he established the Norman keep (the White Tower), which was the central stronghold of the fortress-castle known as the Tower of London. Since disorder in the realm provoked unrest in the city, London usually supported strong, orderly government, especially in such crises as the deposition of Edward II (1327) and Richard II (1399), the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381, and the rebellion headed by Jack Cade (1450).

The opening of the Metropolitan Line, a steam railway, in 1863 and the construction of Holborn Viaduct in 1869 were accompanied by the building of new Thames bridges and the rebuilding of Battersea, Westminster, and Blackfriars bridges. Main line railway termini were built on the edge of the built-up area (Paddington, Euston, St. Pancras, King’s Cross), but eventually most of the railways from the south carried their lines across the Thames to the central business district on the north bank, with termini at Victoria, Charing Cross, Blackfriars, and Cannon Street.
